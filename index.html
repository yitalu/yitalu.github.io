<p>I am a social scientist with a background in political science, economics, and physics. My research investigates how culture and population changes interact with our socio-political development. Specific topics include how value change shapes our modern world, the effects of population changes on politics, and the cultural evolution of fertility transition. The main approach is theoretical and statistical computational modeling.</p>

<!-- <p>My research investigates cultural and demographic determinants and consequences of global development. Specific topics include how culture and value changes shape our modern world, the effects of population changes on politics, and the cultural evolution of fertility transition. The research methods are agent-based modeling, game theory, statistical inference, and lab experiments.</p> -->

<p>Broadly, I am also interested in political economy â€” how political and economic factors interact and affect our society. I study cooperation in multilevel and political settings, particularly the collective action problem within a group when the members face the same out-group competitors. I am also interested in the relationship between political polarization and wealth inequality in the US context and the dynamics of electoral competition.</p>
