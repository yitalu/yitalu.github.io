<p>I am a political economist/scientist in the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/index.html">Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture</a> and the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/birthrites/">BirthRites</a> Lise Meitner research group at the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology</a>.</p>

<p>My research investigates cultural and demographic determinants and consequences of global development. Specific topics include how culture and value changes shape our modern world, the effects of population changes on politics, and the cultural evolution of fertility transition.</p>
<!-- <p>My research investigates economic, political, and sociocultural determinants and consequences of demographic changes. Specific topics include how wealth distribution and intergenerational transfer interact with demographic transitions, what political and institutional factors shape the above process, and the cultural evolution of fertility decline.</p> -->

<p>Broadly, I am interested in political economy â€” how political and economic factors interact and affect our society. I study cooperation in multilevel and political settings, particularly the collective action problem within a group when the members face the same out-group competitors. I am also interested in the relationship between political polarization and wealth inequality in the US context and the dynamics of electoral competition.</p>
<!-- <p>My research investigates long-term social and political processes in human society. I develop theoretical models on demographic transitions to understand the cultural evolution of fertility decline. I also study cooperation in political settings in my doctoral dissertation, particularly the collective action problems in interest group coalitions when the members face common policy opponents. I am also interested in the dynamics of political polarization and electoral competition.</p> -->

<p>My research perspective incorporates political economy, behavioral economics, evolutionary anthropology, and cultural evolution. The methods include agent-based modeling, game theory, statistical inference, and lab experiments.</p>
<!-- <p>I take advantage of the perspectives from political economy, behavioral economics, and cultural evolution to answer my research questions. The methods include agent-based modeling, game theory, lab experiments, and statistical analysis.</p> -->

<p>I have a background in political science, economics, and physics and received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">Political Science</a> from <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a> in May 2021.</p>
