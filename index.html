<p>I am a social scientist and postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/index.html">Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture</a> and the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/birthrites/">BirthRites</a> research group at the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology</a>.</p>

<p>My research investigates long-term social and political processes in human society. I develop theoretical models on demographic transitions to understand the cultural evolution of fertility decline. I also study cooperation in political settings in my doctoral dissertation, particularly the collective action problems in interest group coalitions when the members face common policy opponents. I am also interested in the dynamics of political polarization and electoral competition.</p>

<p>I take advantage of the perspectives from political economy, behavioral economics, and cultural evolution to answer my research questions. The methods include computational modeling, game theory, lab experiments, and statistical analysis.</p>

<!-- <p>My research interests center around the evolution of human behavior and social/political processes. I develop theoretical models on cultural evolution and demographic transitions. The goal is to understand the origin, maintenance, and spread of fertility changes in diverse contexts.</p>

<p>I also study cooperation in political settings. My doctoral <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/a3e976ab3dbb119289dcab06d1fdabd7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y">dissertation</a> concerns the collective action problems in interest group coalitions and how the might of policy opponents affects their cooperative behavior. The methods include game theory, agent-based modeling, and lab experiments.</p> -->

<p>I have a background in political science, economics, and physics and received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">Political Science</a> from <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a> in May 2021.</p>

<!-- <p>I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">Political Science</a> and a graduate affiliate of the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/">Center for Behavioral Political Economy</a> at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a>.</p> -->

<!-- <p>My research applies computational and experimental methods (agent-based modeling, behavioral economic games) to study behavioral political economy. Substantive topics include collective actions, electoral competition, political polarization, and the spread of misinformation.</p> -->

<!-- <p>My dissertation concerns the collective action problems in interest group coalitions and how the might of policy opponents affects their cooperative behavior. The three chapters consist of a game-theoretic model, an agent-based simulation, and a lab experiment. The study aims to provide insight into climate negotiation, interest group politics, and human cooperation in general.</p> -->

<!-- <p>I will join the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology as a postdoctoral researcher since September 2021.</p> -->
